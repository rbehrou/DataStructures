# Question:

Find the greatest common divisor of two given integers ($a, b$). The greatest common divisor is an integer that divides both $a$ and $b$.

Input: two integers ($a, b >= 0$)

Output: $gcd(a,b)$

# Lemma:

Let $r$ be the reminder when $a$ is divided by $b$, therefore:

$gcd(a,b)$ = $gcd(r,b)$ = $gcd(b,r)$

# Example:

The greatest common divisor of $a = 3918848$ and $b = 1653264$ is $61232$.
