# Question:

Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.

Input: A sequence of non-negative integers.

Output: The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence.


# Example 1:

Input: n = 3, [1 2 3]

Output: 6


# Example 2:

Input: n = 10, [7 5 14 2 8 8 10 1 2 3]

Output: 140
 

# Constraints:

2 <= n <= 2*10^5

0 <= a1 ,...,an <= 2*10^5
