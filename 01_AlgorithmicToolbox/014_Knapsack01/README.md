# Question:

Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of $N$ items, find a subset of these items which will give maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given capacity, $C$. Write a function that returns the maximum profit.

# Constraints:

Each item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or skip it.
